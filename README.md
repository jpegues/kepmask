# kepmask
**kepmask** is a package that generates Keplerian masks for protoplanetary disks.  **kepmask** will more than likely be expanded in the future.  For now, it is a module containing several functions used to generate the Keplerian masks (*kepmask.py*), along with an example script for running those functions (*demo_kepmask.py*).

COMING SOON: a full discussion of the code's functionality and methodology.  For now, details will be presented in Pegues et al. (in review as of summer 2019).
